# Compatibility

## Unity Version Support

### Primary Support: Unity LTS

This package prioritizes Unity LTS (Long Term Support) releases. The current LTS version receives full support and testing.

### Previous LTS Support

The previous LTS version is also supported, though with reduced priority. Critical fixes will be backported, but new features may not be tested on previous LTS.

### Tech Stream

Tech stream (non-LTS) Unity versions receive passive compatibility. The package may work on tech stream versions, but:

- No explicit testing is performed
- No guarantees are made
- Issues specific to tech stream versions may not be prioritized

## Current Support Matrix

| Unity Version | Support Level | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Current LTS | Full Support | Primary target |
| Previous LTS | Supported | Reduced priority |
| Tech Stream | Passive | No guarantees |
